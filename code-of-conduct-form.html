<h2>Code of Conduct Form</h2>
<p>This form is meant as a way to anonymously submit any information you want the care team to know</p>
<p>Since the information is sent anonymously, we will have no way of contacting you, so it will obviously
  be harder for the care team to determine the seriousness of the issue, but we do realize that sometimes
  sending information anonymously is the only safe way to do it and we will take anything sent this way
  very seriously.</p>
  <p>If you <em>do</em> want to hear back from us, please include your email adress or phone number in the message</p>
