## Code Of Conduct

The heart of the Ruby Unconference is people. [This guideline](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/) is meant to support a happy, productive and safe event experience that can welcome new ideas and inspiration for all attendees. Regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it.

## Unconf you say?

What exactly is an Unconference? It works like this: Everybody can propose a talk. Everybody votes for the talks they want to see. The most voted talks will be held. You decide what will happen!

Do you want to propose a talk? Or are interested in a topic you want to hear about? Our App for collecting these ideas will be up soon. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyUnConfEU">@RubyUnConfEU</a>on Twitter to be notified.
