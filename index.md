## Let's meet and talk about Ruby

Ruby Unconf Hamburg 2018 will probably happen around May 2018. We're currently trying to secure a venue and fix a date.

## Code Of Conduct

The heart of the Ruby Unconference is people. [This guideline](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/) is meant to support a happy, productive and safe event experience that can welcome new ideas and inspiration for all attendees. Regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it.
