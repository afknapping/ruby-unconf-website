# The Ruby Unconf Website Repo

## Dev Setup

- clone
- bundle install
- jekyll serve

## Rules

- Only use things that work on github's jekyll setup as we currently host this page through GH pages.
- If you're not part of the core team (@p0wl, @halfbyte), use PRs for committing changes, please.
(Except for when it's really, really urgent, of course)
- If it works, it works.
